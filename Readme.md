# ArxivBot

This Python script downloads from ``arxiv.org/list/<category>/new'' and looks for papers with specific keyword or authors.

At the end it generates a text file with the filtered papers. Should be used with cron to automate.

Modify the code to specify where to save the file, the keywords and the categories.
